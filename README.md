# tarasov-calculus

This project is the digitised version of Lev Tarasov's Calculus. We have scanned 
the book and OCRed the contents. The typesetting has been done with XeLaTeX. 

You will need all the packages in the preamble to compile the document correctly.


Colors 

The color theme for the document uses IndianRed, SteelBlue and CornflowerBlue.

Fonts 

We have used Garamond as the main font.

Each chapter has a seperate .tex file for easier management.

Figures 

The figures are placed right now into two folders. One folder has scans in the 
form of PDF and PNGs. Other folder has tikz and ggb files, but this set is not 
complete as yet. Some of the diagrams have been recreated using TiKz, 
mostly from using the export option in GeoGebra.
